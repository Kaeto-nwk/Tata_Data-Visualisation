2. The Netherlands and Ireland were the two highest revenue-generating countries 285k and 283k respectively, which is evidenced by the high quantity sold in these countries.

## Recommendations 

- Further analysis into customer satisfaction and retention to understand why some countries have a higher demand for online retailers' products whilst others do not. The countries with Lower demand are potential areas to expand to as there is some interest in the company's products, more analysis into why the demand is so small would provide insight into solutions to rectify this problem.
